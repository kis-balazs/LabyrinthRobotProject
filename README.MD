## LabyrinthRobotProject

The game consists of following the white path with the robot from the starting position to the :checkered_flag: using the arrows.
Each button press will 'cost' **:+1: step**, and at the finish the game will inform the player about how many points they gathered at the current level.

  - can add any number of levels, created in notepad in the form of a matrix, and store it in the ExtData folder with the pattern of the name : **levelX.txt**, x being the next number after the bigges existing one
  - in case of new level added, need to modify totalLevels variable to the exact number of levels in UI.java
  
:shipit: Currently planning on creating a *high score system* and a more *user-friendly level editor*
