## LabyrinthRobotProject

The game consists of following the white path with the robot from the starting position to the :finish: using the arrows.
Each button press will 'cost' a step, and at the finish the game will inform the player about how many points they gathered at the current level.

  - can add any number of levels, created in notepad in the form of a matrix, and store it in the ExtData folder with the pattern of the name : levelX, x being the next number after the bigges existing one
  - in case of new level added, need to modify totalLevels variable to the exact number of levels in UI.java
  
:shipit: Currently planning on creating a high score system and a more user-friendly level editor
